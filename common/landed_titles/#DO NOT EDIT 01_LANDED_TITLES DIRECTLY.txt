#Do not edit 01_landed_titles under any circumstance. Your changes will be overwritten when we re-run the mapfiller tool.

#Mirror the title/s you want to change in a 02_OVERRIDE_filename.txt file.

#An example is the 02_OVERRIDE_vanilla_hardcoded_titles.txt, which has a few hardcoded titles in it. One particular title being overwritten from the 01_landed_titles.txt is k_papal_state, which default rules from God's Eye as a debug region.
