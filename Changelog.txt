        - Eyrie now has the highest fort level of any holding when built, but takes a big hit to garrison size.
        - Levy reinforcement reduced in castles, making levy reinforcement buildings more important.
        - Many unique buildings reduce overall tax income by a percentage, rather than by a fixed value, to make their impact on economy more significant.
        - Pirate and wildling buildings are now destroyed when conquered by a foreign culture.
        - Pirate and wildling buildings nerfed (for castles and tribal) and higher levels are now also less common.

        - Static modifier values for castles/cities/temples edited.
        - Temples provide a small number of knights.

        - Hill Clansmen region in the North has been downgraded from Mountains terrain to Hills.
        ~ Mountains of the Moon, Bloody Gate and the Mountain Clans region are among them.
    ~ Night's Watch is no longer de jure North.
    ~ Restored Strong & Weak to their former vanilla function. Once again congenital traits, due to the presence of Zeus Brawny and frail. Effect is lower than vanilla, and offers no fertility bonus.
    ~ Strong / Weak Physique renamed to Strong/Weak Constitution, with a bigger impact on health and a boost to fertility.
    ~ The 'Pope' (High Septon) is no longer landed as a baron in oldtown, but landless.
    ~ Trait edits.
        - Gregarious grants a single point into intrigue, as social characters may decieve others more easily or learn things they otherwise would not.
        - Heartless now correctly conflicts with cruel.
        - Slothful now grants a small learning boost, since lazy characters may be more inclined to read.
        - Sociopath now conflicts with content, humble, shy and trusting to better reflect more common traits associated with it.
    ~ Valyria will now face independence revolts if ruled by a foreign house, be it Valyrian or not to prevent exploiting of mechanics.
    ~ You are no longer able to convert to spouse religion when you already share their religion (thanks for multiple community reports!).
    ~ You should now be able to swear fealty to the AI (King-to-King), so long as they like you (have at least 30 opinion).

    + A number of new rivers and streams in the North and the Vale.
    + Consolidation of Realms decision. Can be repeated for each of the Seven Kingdoms, destroying all Kingdoms in favour of a single Kingdom. Also grants 2k prestige.
    + Mostly unqiue unit modifiers for most of the cultures.

	- New culture buildings added for Ironborn group (Islander, Harlawn, & Pykem), Skagosi, & Fairman
~ Globally increased movement speed.

    - Colours are now more colourful and vibrant, with more 'full' Empire tier titles.

    - Old Gods pay 2500 prestige to swear the oath.
    - Other religions pay 3000 prestige to swear the oath.

~ Fixed conversion decision checking for sympathy_westerosi_pagan instead of westerosi_pagan_group

~ Zealous and Glutton no longer reduce health, due to issue of people randomly dying due to being zealous at young age.
    - Zealous as a result now reduces tax instead of improving it. Rather than attracting more tax from zealous peasants, it can be regarded as their zeal encouraging them to donate to their church or cause.
~ Zealous is now correctly set to be the opposite of the Westeros and Essos sympathy religion traits.
~ Modified AI effects caused by a few traits. Dishonourable, Honourable and Irrational should have a bigger impact on AI.

27517-S-1.3A
~ CB Tweaks and Fixes:
    - Conquest CB should no longer fail when used against same faith.
    - County Conquest CB cost reduced to 50 prestige a pop, due to negative effects sustained from owning a county outside of a duchy you own.
    - Duchy Conquest CB cost reduced to 250 prestige a pop, to bring it in line with the county conquest.
    - Kingdom Conquest CB cost reduced to 800 prestige a pop, to bring it in line with the county and duchy conquests.
    - Kingdom and Duchy Conquest CB can be used against same religion now, until we have seperate Casus Belli for different religions.
~ Skagosi should no longer be forced to wildling tribal government due to movement of Skagosi culture into first men.
~ Modified all factions to use our scripted join requirement. Should prevent all from joining factions against Valyria and The Night's Watch.
~ A number of attrition tweaks.
    - Reduced winter attrition across the board somewhat.
    - Reduced rate of attrition across the board somewhat.
    - Supply limit for all terrain (excl. barrens) types increased slightly.

~ The Dreadlands have been modified somewhat.

    - The Karstarks of House Bolton are now independent.
    ? This change was made to better balance the dreadfort. The Karstarks were rather strong, often forming independence factions against the boltons.
    ? It also did not make a whole lot of sense for the (Kar)starks to be under house Bolton. Furthermore, the change should make Bolton expansion somewhat easier.
~ North Empire tier colour adjusted to be lighter and more white, but with a blue tint.
~ A number of new nicknames, many of them specific to certain houses.
~ An array of nerfs, reducing the effective strength of many characters.
~ Halved the levy size of the stepstone pirates and reduced both their tech and the frequency of higher level shipyards.
~ Combat education fixed, now correctly checking the educator instead of deprecated guardian.
~ Corrected the Wynelands title flag.
~ Changed the color of the De-Jure Stepstones.
~ Removed the celibate traits from many children.
+ Added House Trait.
    ? Very basic trait. Pulls the Dynasty of your character's grandfather and displays it.
    ? Will be improved in future versions, by giving it to daughters as well as sons.
    ? Basically a modified Muslim trait.
+ Added a number of new resources and province modifiers, which will distributed across the world.
    - Many provinces have been set to either major/minor trade and population hubs. Unique effects will be added down the line.
    - A number of natural harbours have been added - unique buildings will be added for these locations down the line.
+ Added Dragonstone and Dragonmont Buildings.
+ Added Sisterman Shipyards.

    - Darklyn 
    - Rowan
    - Vhassar (Valyrian Freehold)
+ Many additions and edits to the Wildlings, from new characters, traits to ancestors.
+ Added resources to a number of locations.
    - Honeyholt now has honey.
    - Some Crackclaw provinces got tin.
    - Casterly Rock and Castamere got Gold instead of silver. A number of Westerland provinces were also tweaked resource wise.
    - White Knife given precious fabrics (furs) instead of silver.
    ? Neither tin nor honey have buildings at the moment, however, only a minor province effects.

23517-S-1.2A
= Quite a lot, but too much to put into the changelog. Changes are very extensive.
- Stripped music from the mod. Back to vanilla music until we find music we can use without possibly infringing on copyrights. Music included was uncertain, so removing so to be safe than sorry.
~ Every single Vanilla event and Decision has been edited heavily. Many events have been excluded from the mod, to avoid issues relating to them.
~ Fixed starting buildings for a number of holdings, including but not limited to Oldstones, Oldtown, Arbor, Highgarden, Casterly Rock and Storm's End.
~ Modified ambition events and stripped out all buddhist related events and a (vanilla issue) duplicated paragon objective.
~ Modified factions, removing references to muslim and catholic faiths and pagan related restrictions.
~ Modified positions of every single port and army location, as well as many city locations. A good few hundred provinces touched, so some may have been overlooked.
~ Modified plots, removing references to vanilla religions.
~ Modified focuses, removing references to vanilla religions.
~ Buffed the base value of cities, castles and temples for a number of reasons. Should also help make raiding more worthwhile, as there will be more to raid.
~ Extensive number of custom scripted triggers, used to enhance factions
    - Dornish are now less likely to join factions against their liege so long as their liege is Dornish.
    - Marcher cultures are now less likely to join factions against their liege so long as their liege is of the same group.
    - Old Gods followers are more loyal to their own people.
    - Drowned, Valyrian, Seven and Eastern Pagans are far less loyal when under a foreign religion.
    - Valyrians (culture) are just more ambitious.
    - Council members are more loyal, even with no empowered council. However, they are also more dangerous if they do not like you (and are not empowered).
    - Eastern Religion group and cultures are generally less likely to form factions.
~ Dukes may now form or join the loyalist faction.
~ Moved reachman, manderish and shield islander into first man group.
~ Factions have been overhauled with a wide variety of conditions and scripted effects.
    - Vassals who like you should be overall less likely to join factions against you.
    - Distance, Culture and Religion have a big impact on joining loyalist or independence factions.
    - Some groups are just more likely to split off, whilst others are more tolerant. The iron born, for example, will be far less tolerant of weaker rulers.
    - Your heir, so long as they like you and share the same culture and religion, will be very loyal.
    - Don't trust sociopaths - they don't care if you are a good person or not.
    - Factions will not form against Valyria before the year 7000, due to the power behind the Valyrian Empire. However, the opinion bonus for the Valyrian Viceroy has been nerfed, so expect intrigue and assassination.
~ Many traits have been modified. Mod specific traits that were missing effects have been given actual effects.
~ A number of nicknames have been modified or fixed.
~ Many more characters have been giving fighting/dueling traits, which in turn have been named into "[Rank] Warrior" rather than "[Rank] Duelist" to better reflect their current role.
~ Localisation has been tweaked by SweetThose, so we are no longer using the silly generated adjectives, but some much more sensical hand-made ones by him. Thanks!
~ A number of defines tweaks have been integrated at the suggestiong of SweetThose, including but not limited to reduced loss of levy on disband, making it overall less punishing.
~ Wildling characters have been expanded upon by tsf4, and a wide array of traits have been added, making the region far more interesting to play in!
~ Many more flags have been added, although many are placeholders.
+ Added shipyard building for Tarth.
+ More family members, and ancestors for houses:
	- Stark
	- Karstark
	- Redwyne
