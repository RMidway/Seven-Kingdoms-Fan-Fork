# falls under mystical game rule, if completely disabled then no green dreams.
# available even with light fantasy rule (GoT lore)

# greensight.1 - on_action random
# Generic dreams, flavour event. Can award a GDS or change attributes and traits for better or for worse.

# greensight.2 - on_action random
# Unconcious sight
# This event is fairly rare, and occurs in younger characters.
# Depending on their opinion of their guardian, they may or may not communicate these dreams.

# greensight.2
# Ping event to parent, notifying them that their child has been having dreams - dreams that could well be green dreams.
# AI much more likely to use this option if they have gained the green dreams trait, are of a fearful personality AND have a high enough opinion of guardian.
# guardian will have the option to suppress green dreams if they are not of westerosi pagan, awarding a flag, prevents development.

# greensight.3
# further dreaming for unconcious dreamers, can result in awakening.
# grant events where they see through the eyes of other characters or animals. which affects what abilities they are granted.
# awakening means more random dreams, and greater chance of more powerful effects.

# greensight.4
# further dreaming for awakening dreamers, can result in awakened.
# visit weirwood trees remotely, offer a chance to grant a sacrifice - what it should be varies based on character traits.
# obtain familiar or a magical ability based on results of event 4
# awakened grants much more powerful effects, and results in no chance of no effect.
