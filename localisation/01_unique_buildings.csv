ca_widows_watch_desc;Located at the tip of a peninsula between the Bite and the Shivering Sea, Widow's Watch is a sturdy stronghold on a cliff along the frigid, rocky shore. Passing ships are spotted in the treacherous waters from its watchtowers, and the smell of sea spray hangs in the air.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wolfsden;The Wolf's Den;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wolfsden_desc;The Wolf's Den is an ancient castle built by Jon Stark to defend the mouth of the White Knife from sea raiders. Ramshackle homes attach like barnacles to its crumbling black walls, and the inner depths of the castle hold a large, dank prison. Cadet branches of the Stark family have historically been granted command here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_whiteharbor;White Harbor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_whiteharbor_desc;White Harbor, a major trade port, lies on the eastern shore of the White Knife river. Pale stone walls protect the jewel of the North, extending a mile into the water and dividing the outer harbor from the sheltered side and the city proper. The cobbled streets are orderly and wide, lined by whitewashed houses roofed with dark slate. Seafood is widely available at the fish market, and both wine and whores at an unsavory establishment called the Lazy Eel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_hornwood;Hornwood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_hornwood_desc;Hornwood Castle is a stone and timber stronghold located near the headwaters of the Broken Branch river in a thickly forested area of the Sheepshead Hills, with White Harbor to the south and the neighboring Dreadfort to the north.

ca_flint_keep;Flint Keep;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_flint_keep_desc;Barely mentionable by southron standards, but mighty compared to typical Hill Clansmen settlements, Flint Keep is a wooden ringfort-style holdfast nestled in a high valley of the Northern Mountains. Sheep graze the surrounding meadows and rugged granite hills, while fierce clansmen guard vigilantly against possible Wildling raids. It is the ancestral home of House Flint.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_arrendell;Arrendell;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_arrendell_desc;Perched among the rolling mists and steep forested slopes of the Northern Mountains is glimmering Arrendell, a small castle keep hewn from the same gem-encrusted rock that it rests upon. A winding footpath leads up to its front gate with water rapids on one side feeding into Long Lake far below and to the south. Bordering Brandon's Gift to the north, Arrendell was reinforced from its original timber construction by House Liddle after repeated Wildling incursions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_bell_tower;Bell Tower;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_bell_tower_desc;Built by House Fisher and situated near a ridgeline of the Stony Shore's hilly upland moors, Bell Tower has a clear view of the sparsely populated villages down closer to the sea. A set of concentric earthen ditches surround the thin, moss-covered tower of stone, with a great bronze bell at the top of it. When Ironborn raiders threaten the fisherfolk and villagers, it is rung for all to hear from far into the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_svalia;Svalia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_svalia_desc;Hidden in the wild rock-strewn highlands of the Mountains of the Moon, Svalia is a Mountain Clan hillfort originally built by the Stone Crows to guard a precarious pass leading to the rest of their lands. From this stronghold, raiding parties have harried travellers and lowland Vale lords since time immemorial. A swift stream flows past it and transforms into a waterfall, depositing a fine mist into a deep chasm where the bones of former clan enemies lie broken and forgotten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_strongsong;Strongsong;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_strongsong_desc;Far upriver from Heart's Home to the east, Strongsong is the seat of House Belmore, so named for the six silver bells in its high central keep. An important Vale bastion as strong as its name suggests, Strongsong's bells chime to warn of Mountain Clan attacks. There are four courtyards that must be successively breached to reach the central keep's entrance, and crenellated semi-circular exterior castle walls face outward to the glacial lakes and snow-capped peaks beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_coldwater;Coldwater Burn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_coldwater_desc;Coldwater Burn is an unusual castle west of the Fingers and north of Snakewood, with a deceptively deep stream, or burn, flowing straight through its center. A narrow bridge spans across, leading to identical fortified stone keeps on either side. Thick iron gates prevent entry, and interior ladders lead to open parapets above, from which bowmen may rain down fire upon would-be intruders. This is the ancestral seat of House Coldwater. Many a foe has regretted attempting to assault by the stream's edge, which pulls them mercilessly into its unknown depths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_snakewood;Snakewood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_snakewood_desc;South of Coldwater and north of Heart's Home, Snakewood lies at the edge of the Snakewood Forest from which its name derives. It overlooks the farmland dotting a stretch of open land by the bay, and was built with great quantities of dark timber from the forest. A long and narrow outer bailey slopes uphill to braced wooden gates and flanking towers protecting an inner courtyard, a small weirwood grove, and a rustic great hall that is the seat of House Lynderly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_thumb;The Thumb;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_thumb_desc;A simple cylindrical tower resembling a thumb and made of old wind-battered flint rocks, The Thumb is the ancestral seat of House Baelish. It is a dreary place beside a peat bog, on a peninsula north of Longbow Hall. Arrowslits offer some defense, and an open staircase spirals around the inner wall, with servants and a kitchen on the first floor, a modest hall above, and bedchambers on the topmost floor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_longbow_hall;Longbow Hall;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_longbow_hall_desc;An ancient fortification erected by House Hunter around their great hunting lodge, protecting the forests and foothills of the eastern Vale. Renowned for their fine longbowmen, it is thought that Bronze King Robar II Royce won the Hunters as First Men allies through an archery competition. Longbow Hall itself is of timber construction, with wooden palisades and earthen ramparts in a circular design around the lodge. A very deep spiked trench limits direct assault and leaves attackers vulnerable to sustained archer fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_hardvale;Hardvale;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_hardvale_desc;In the heart of a long river valley and cradled by a crescent-shaped series of heathland hills, Hardvale is hidden from view along the densely forested riverside road until nearly upon it. The castle is a stout and square one of ashen grey stone, with an open courtyard and four fat towers in each corner. Murder holes and an iron-barred gate lend extra strength, and it guards the lowland eastern pass to Gulltown from the Eyrie and the Bloody Gate. House Hardyng calls this land home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_redfort;Redfort;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_redfort_desc;The Redfort, ancestral seat of House Redfort, is an impressive mountain fortress east of Gulltown and Runestone, and north of the Bay of Crabs. Chiseled out of reddish tinted rock, and situated on top of an isolated plateau, the Redfort has a relatively small footprint but is towering in height and viewable from a great distance. The only passage to the fort is a series of steep switchbacks carved from the cliffside, and an iron cage and winch able to lift up visitors and supplies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ironoaks;Ironoaks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ironoaks_desc;Ironoaks is the principal seat of House Waynwood, at the edge of a lake with a river flowing past and emptying into the Narrow Sea. Across the bay to the south is Runestone, and to the northeast is Longbow Hall. Ironoaks is named for its exceptional quality of oak wood, from which the fortress was built. It is remarkably resistant to rot, and while stonework was later used for the central keep, the outer walls are enormous logs with a moated trench all around the exterior. A drawbridge is the only entrance, and the trench is flooded with lake water when siege is expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_saltpans;Saltpans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_saltpans_desc;Playing second fiddle to wealthy Maidenpool across the Bay of Crabs, Saltpans is nonetheless a minor trading power in its own right with a thriving salt-harvesting industry. Rickety multi-storied wooden inns and shops lean in over the narrow muddy streets, which become better built and maintained as the hill to Saltpans Castle is ascended. A moderately-sized fortification, the castle is seat to House Hawick. It dominates the town and overlooks the bay where crab and fish are hauled in and the flats are crowded by smallfolk piling salt at low tide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_acorn_hall;Acorn Hall;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_acorn_hall_desc;Acorn Hall is the ancestral home of House Smallwood, set in lush woodlands east of Pinkmaiden and Wayfarer's Rest. Though the yard and castle as a whole are quite small, there is a basic curtain wall of stone erected around it, and a mighty oaken keep at its center. Thatched kennels and stables are attached to the keep's exterior in the yard, and a regionally famous smithy and forgeworks supply an extensive soldiers' barracks that is present on the first floor, which makes Acorn Hall a nasty business to assault even after the outer wall is breached.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_fairmarket;Fairmarket;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_fairmarket_desc;Located mostly on the southern shore of the Blue Fork and just east of Raventree Hall, Fairmarket is an important regional center of trade for the whole Riverlands. A key crossing over the water leads north, in the form of a wooden bridge. Merchants and farmers alike do business here, come from the rich surrounding land. Wares are hawked from the bustling town market, and a modest but well-constructed stone tower-house serves as seat to House Paege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_pinkmaiden;Pinkmaiden;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_pinkmaiden_desc;Pinkmaiden is a sizable settlement in the southern Riverlands, to the west of Acorn Hall and north of Stoney Sept, extending along a tributary river and receiving protection from Pinkmaiden Castle, seat of House Piper and one of the great bastions of the Faith of the Seven. The surrounding land is comprised of gently sloping hills and woodland, and the castle itself is at a sandy bend in the river, moat and drawbridge aiding defense. The decorative stonework is pinkish in color, and the front gate's arched shape is thought to resemble the womanly part of a maiden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stoney_sept;Stoney Sept;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stoney_sept_desc;Near the headwaters of the Blackwater Rush is Stoney Sept, which refers to the great sept of Stone atop a hill, where bells can be heard chiming through the day, and the walled town built up around it. Directly below the sept is a small but stout holdfast of grey stone, and past that is a market square with a marble fountain in the shape of a leaping trout. The alleys beyond are filled with alehouses and assorted homes, one of which has been converted into an infamous inn and brothel named the Peach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_harrowaytown;Lord Harroway's Town;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_harrowaytown_desc;Upriver from the Ruby Ford and sitting along the Trident is Lord Harroway's Town, a minor center of trade and important rest stop for travellers crossing the waters north or south. Ferries pass to and from the waterside docks, and near the center of town are a seven-sided sept and large inn. House Harroway has historically ruled from an old stone roundtower keep on a rare patch of elevated land. Some distance away is the famed Inn at the Crossroads and the Kingsroad beside it, where low water levels allow passage by horse instead of boat before the Trident fully merges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tridents_holdfast;Trident's Holdfast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tridents_holdfast_desc;Trident's Holdfast is a strong wooden fortification within the heavily forested hills south of Stone Hedge, where a plethora of streams feed both the Trident and God's Eye. The land is elevated enough to offer ample view of the fertile riverland beneath, ideal for early warning of hostile approach. Watchtowers dot the area and can be lit when intruders are spotted, and near the highest point is a sacred grove of ancient weirwoods, rumoured by local smallfolk to be haunted by slain Children of the Forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_goodfaith;Goodfaith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_goodfaith_desc;South of the Neck and north of Seagard is Goodfaith, among the largest of permanent Crannogman settlements. The land here is blessed with burbling springs and teems with fowl, fish, and other creatures of the marsh. Above the water is a vast network of crannogs, manmade islands consisting of thatch and sticks and logs. These are scattered around an ancient tower dwarfing any other structure, vines and moss climbing halfway up its worn stonework, and nearby is a small patch of gnarled but living weirwoods, human faces etched into their bark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wycombe;Wycombe Manor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wycombe_desc;Between mountain and river lies the land of hills, where freshwater streams flow swiftly down before merging into the languid Greek Fork. The Terricks of Wycombe built an immense brick manor here and made it their seat, above the marshes and fens where green grass and golden grain sustain herds of livestock. One side of the manor house is fortified by an exterior curtain wall, and the other presses right up to a river's embankment. Turret towers house archers, and the front gate is of dense iron bars. While not impervious, the manor is well-fortified and open to smallfolk when local villages are threatened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_chiltern;Chiltern;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_chiltern_desc;North of Darry and Lord Harroway's Town along the route to the North, Chiltern Keep rests on a slightly elevated hill overlooking the swirling pools and streams of the Green Fork's tributary waters. Soft soil made fertile by silt deposits is plowed by many a farm, while the old stone keep with its lone watchtower is used as a safehold in times of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_atranta;Spire of Atranta;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_atranta_desc;Here lies the tall and slender spire of Atranta, inlaid with decorative marble and fine silver veins masking the baser stonework beneath. A demonstration of wealth, this was once the principal seat of House Vance and is still held by them. From the uppermost balcony, one can spot the Isle of Faces at the center of the God's Eye and enjoy the cool breeze. Beneath that are the lordly chambers and guest quarters. Lower levels house a small garrison, kitchens, and the servants, with a stables and some worked farmland nearby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_the_crag;The Crag;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_the_crag_desc;Northeast of Castamere and west of the Banefort, The Crag is an isolated stronghold watching over the plains beneath from a rocky outcropping along the coast of the Sunset Sea. It is the ancestral seat of House Westerling, which traces its descent back to the First Men. Battered by violent storms, but in a prime position to intercept any nearby force, it is an ancient place that has seen continuous occupation in spite of costly upkeep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ashemark;Ashemark;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ashemark_desc;Ashemark is located in the hilly terrain where the headwaters of the Tumblestone river first form, before merging into the Red Fork of the Trident. It is a major stronghold of the Westerlands, guarding a mountain pass between the Golden Hills and the lands of the Banefort. A lone road leads past a village and up a cliffside to its heavily fortified walls, with rounded corner towers and crenellated parapets. This is the principal seat of House Marbrand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_golden_tooth;The Golden Tooth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_golden_tooth_desc;The Golden Tooth is a small but strong stone fortress commanding the hill road and guarding a pass through the mountains, and thus important for travel to and from the Riverlands. For secure passage, it is necessary that an invading army hold or neutralize this point. Furthermore, the hills here are rich with gold ore and have supplied House Lefford with substantial wealth. Vaults and mining shafts beneath the keep contain a major store of this gold and are guarded around the clock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_payne_hall;Payne Hall;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_payne_hall_desc;Known to produce loyal and stalwart warriors, the marcher lords of House Payne built a squat and sturdy castle here around their original wooden hall, each successive generation reinforcing it with their labor. At the border between the Reach, Westerlands, and Riverlands, Payne Hall is vital for repelling incursions and is much appreciated by the smallfolk who live in the gently rolling foothills nearby, taking shelter within during times of hardship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_riverspring;Riverspring;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_riverspring_desc;Near the source of the Blackwater Rush, Riverspring is noteworthy for the many springheads gushing out of the fertile earth, which sustain flourishing farmland and a prominent market town of craftsmen and traders. At the heart of the town is the castle, held by House Sarwyck. Built directly over top one of the springs, it has an endless source of fresh water should a siege occur. The castle also boasts a fine godswood and an impressive study filled with scholarly books and exotic trinkets from beyond the Narrow Sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_cornfield;Cornfield;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_cornfield_desc;Cornfield is a rural land east of Crakehall and south of the mountains, where foothills soften into plains and the fields sway with corn and other grains, and livestock graze freely. Runoff from the mountains collects into a broad river, Cornfield Castle standing proudly beside it and villagers diverting the water for irrigation. A knightly tradition is strong here, where the land is suited to horse and lance, and men are eager to prove their valor against southerly rivals of the Reach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_bower;The Bower;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_bower_desc;Like Cornfield to its immediate north, Greenfield is rural and separate in both culture and geography from the mountainous hills of the rest of the Westerlands. The wooded plains are home to fruit and nut orchards, and knights defend their land on horseback. Most impressive, however, is the Bower, an immense castle built by House Greenfield entirely out of bone white weirwood. It is thus extremely sturdy, and the red weeping sap has been used to decorate the great hall in ornate patterns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_deep_den;Deep Den;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_deep_den_desc;Guarding the nearby Goldroad is the Deep Den, a seemingly modest tower house with a training yard, a pond, and dark grey exterior walls that dwarf its size. This is merely the outer keep. The echoing chambers of the inner keep and vast depths of the fortress are carved right out of the hillside, converted in centuries past from a network of mining tunnels and polished to a lordly standard. These efforts were presided over by House Lydden, who made the Deep Den their ancestral seat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_silverhall;Silverhall;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_silverhall_desc;Deep in a secluded valley and across a mountain range to the east of Lannisport, Silverhall shines with its pale, roughly-hewn stone walls speckled with silver. Below it is a shanty town where miners and herders eke out a living in the hilly terrain. Through the front gate, a sculpture of a peacock greets visitors, the symbol that also emblazons House Serrett's arms. Throughout the courtyard here are weirwoods, shading the path to the inner keep, and a private smelter where silver ore is refined into ingots.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_hawthorne;The Sable Circle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_hawthorne_desc;The hills of Hawthorne stand above the plains and farms of neighboring lands. Gold may be scarce, but baser metals are riddled throughout the rocky terrain. These support a multitude of smithies and metalworks, and a sizable town that grew under the protection of House Hawthorne from their unusual seat of power, the Sable Circle. It is a wooden keep, brownish black in color and round in design. There is an inner courtyard open to the sky and filled with hawthorn trees, which flower beautifully and shelter songbirds that feed on their ripe berries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_kayce;Kenning Keep;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_kayce_desc;On a peninsula south of Fair Isle and west of Casterly Rock, Kayce is comprised of a walled market town of many wattle and daub homes, with a lesser number built of the same vibrant red sandstone as Kenning Keep, the seat of House Kenning. It is a small seaside castle, and quite striking - especially during sunsets. Down the road and past a postern gate is a series of stone piers, where ships dock for trade. While no competition for Lannisport across the bay, it serves both the castle and town well enough, and has been fortified against Ironborn raiders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_sows_horn;Sow's Horn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_sows_horn_desc;East of the God's Eye lake where the waters form into the Blackwater Rush, there is a small settlement along the road called the Sow's Horn, shadowed by a towerhouse of substantial size and made of stone walls eight feet thick. Scores of men-at-arms are stationed here, and peasants work the open fields under the protection of House Hogg and their landed leal knights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stokeworth;Stokeworth Manor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stokeworth_desc;Stokeworth is an agricultural powerhouse located in the bountiful, lightly forested plains north of Rosby. House Stokeworth commands the castle here, which is more of a manor house with substantial fortification in the form of turret towers and an iron-barred gatehouse. Crossbowmen watch the horizon, and household knights may sally out from a small first floor barracks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_antlers;The Antlers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_antlers_desc;South of Maidenpool and west of Duskendale, The Antlers is an unassuming square stone keep in a bowl-shaped valley where streams deliver fresh water into the God's Eye, and the woods teem with plentiful game, deer among them. House Buckwell reigns here, a family of skillful huntsmen. Outriders and rangers patrol the surrounding land for their lord, ensuring against poachers and bandits alike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_whispers;The Whispers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_whispers_desc;The Whispers is an ancient triangular castle with square corner towers, built of unmortared stone overgrown by red ivy. It is located at the eastern edge of Crackclaw Point on a cliff overlooking the Narrow Sea. A lone road weaves between soldier pines and weirwoods towards it, up along the cliffside to its curtain wall. One tower nearest the sea rises above the rest, lit by a beacon fire to guide passing ships, and eerie echoes are heard from within the keep, where waves pour into the caverns below. \n\nAccording to legend, these noises are from the victims of Clarence Crabb, fabled lord and knight who brought the severed heads of his victims to his woods witch wife, who reanimated them as disembodied counselors that would talk amongst themselves and offer advice in hushed tones and whispers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_dyre_den;The Dyre Den;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_dyre_den_desc;On the northern side of Crackclaw Point at the end of a road from Maidenpool is the ancestral land of House Brune, a family of First Men origin who command the Dyre Den and historically brought peace to the area. Their castle is a small one that has gone through periods of disrepair, with worn walls and three crooked towers. Despite this, it continues to be an important stronghold protecting the scattered settlements of smallfolk, wary of outsiders, who harvest the local soldier pine and tend their farms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_rooks_rest;Rook's Rest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_rooks_rest_desc;Immediately north of the major trade port of Duskendale, Rook's Rest is a coastal town fishing the sea and bringing in food from the hinterland nearby, where farms and smallholds dot the area. Skirmishes have historically broken out with some regularity between native Crackclawmen and encroaching Duskmen settlers, and House Staunton maintains order from their stone fortress, a set of two walled keeps with a gatehouse and twin archer towers between them. The larger keep houses a soldiers' barracks and training yard, and can bring in supplies from a small waterside pier, down a muddy footpath past a postern gate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_driftmark;Driftmark;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_driftmark_desc;Benefiting from its natural harbor and position in the Narrow Sea, Driftmark is a regional center of trade where the merchants of Essos and Westeros meet, dealing in spices and other goods both mundane and exotic. House Velaryon, distant but noble scions of Valyria, rule the island from Driftmark Castle, which stands at the base of an immense volcano. The walls are of dark stone and the roofs of burnished copper, modeled after architecture from Valyria itself. While beautiful, it is somewhat damp and cramped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_sharp_point;Sharp Point;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_sharp_point_desc;Huddled at the end of the Massey's Hook peninsula and watching over the choppy waters of Blackwater Bay, Sharp Point juts out upon a coastal hillside hundreds of feet above the rocky shoreline below. It is a small keep, but quite defensible owing to its location, and can only be assaulted from one side. The exterior walls are lined by protruding spikes, and a great domed watchtower within garrisons men while also doubling as a lighthouse, the fire atop burning day and night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_haystack_hall;Haystack Hall;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_haystack_hall_desc;East of Bronzegate, Haystack Hall is a holdfast in a forest clearing close to the waters of the Straits of Tarth. It is a humble keep built from white limestone, with a small courtyard and four square corner towers. Between patches of forest are a number of hamlets and vast fields of wheat and other grasses, which are baled into hay for grazing sheep and cattle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_parchments;Parchments;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_parchments_desc;North of Storm's End and west of Tarth, Parchments Castle sits by the waterside between the ocean and mildly sloping plains stretching as far as the eye can see. It is buttressed by a strong sea wall, but otherwise simple in design. The stonework is pale and somewhat crumbling in places, with a central tower keep defended by several smaller towers. The smell of brine wafts in on the wind, and fishing vessels can be spotted offshore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_bronzegate;Bronzegate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_bronzegate_desc;Bronzegate guards the road between Storm's End and the Wendwater. For this reason, it is a regionally important stronghold that benefits from some trade and the support of several nearby villages. The hold itself is rather large, with both an inner and outer bailey, a massive bronze gatehouse between them, and murder holes above it. The walls are solidly constructed of the same whitish stone as other Stormlander castles, stark and militaristic in design.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_belland;Belland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_belland_desc;Belland sits upon a bluff some distance downstream from where two main forks of the Wendwater meet. It is a bare block of a structure and the seat of House Blount. What it lacks in elegance, it makes up for in strength. The walls of the keep and outer wooden palisade are both quite thick, protecting a village within and one side of Belland bridge, which is an important land crossing between Shipbreaker Bay and the Blackwater. A toll is collected here, and logging operations from the Kingswood transport timber by barge from the waters below.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_waterperry;Waterperry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_waterperry_desc;Waterperry is the primary stronghold of the Wendwater, between Massey's Hook and the shores of the Blackwater. Originally a lordly manor house, it has been expanded by a line of Wendwater kings into a formidable citadel overseeing the surrounding plains and farmland. Contained inside the crenellated walls are a sept, a small brook with its own water mill, and lush formal gardens. A secondary keep separates the village from the private estates of House Wendwater, command of which is occasionally bestowed upon loyal vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_fellwood;Fellwood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_fellwood_desc;The fortress of Fellwood can be found at the southern edge of the Kingswood, where morning mist gathers over softly trickling streams and moss blankets the landscape. It is the ancestral home of House Fellwood, who constructed the stalwart timber keep that is now worn with age and overgrown by climbing vines seeking the sun. An old weeping-faced weirwood can be found within the walls, a survivor among the sad stumps where at one time Andal invaders made their mark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_griffins_roost;Griffin's Roost;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_griffins_roost_desc;Small but strong, Griffin's Roost is located on a lofty crag jutting out from the shore and offering comprehensive views of the countryside. The castle lies surrounded by red stone cliffs on three sides, which descend into the stormy waters of Shipbreaker Bay. The land-facing approach is a long natural ridge called the griffin's throat. The entrance to the griffin's throat is guarded on one end by a gatehouse, and by the castle's main gate and two tall round towers on the other end. A well-provisioned garrison can hold the castle against twenty times as many men. \n\nBesides faded tapestries, Griffin's Roost is decorated with arched windows displaying myriad diamond-shaped panes of red and white glass, and the great hall contains the carved and gilded Griffin Seat where countless generations of Conningtons have ruled. Also within the castle are stables, an armory, barracks, and a maester's tower with a rookery. A secret stair under the northwest tower goes to a hidden cove beneath the crag, which appears when the tide is out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_crows_nest;Crow's Nest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_crows_nest_desc;Located in the heavily-forested slopes at the western edge of the Rainwood, the Crow's Nest is a strategically important castle guarding a pass against forces in either direction. It is the ancestral seat of House Morrigen, who built the imposing two-leveled keep for this very purpose, roofed in green-hued slate and constructed of mortared stonework. It is further bolstered by gate houses and watch towers on opposite ends of the outer wall. The courtyard contains detached barracks and stables, and the first floor of the keep has guest quarters and a feast hall. A spiral stairway leads up to a bridge which serves as a chokehold during last-ditch defensive efforts, with the lord and his family's chambers past it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_lockport;Lockport;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_lockport_desc;Lockport's history is one of competition with neighboring Stonehelm to the west and the Weeping Town to the east, all vying for trade within the Stormlands and Dorne. It is a regionally prominent market town and port that has at various times extended its dominion over the Slayne, a major river route known for its rapids and waterfalls. The western portside of town bustles with activity under the watchful eye of House Herston from a formidable seaside bastion, pentagonal in shape and armed with imported Myrish-crafted ballistae facing outward to thwart attack by ship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_weeping_town;Weeping Town;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_weeping_town_desc;The Weeping Town is a wooden-walled market town with a thriving port that handles much of the Stormlands' trade, despite the gloomy weather and rough waters of the surrounding Sea of Wrath. Mud and grime stain the slant-roofed homes crowding over the crooked alleys, and at the edge of town is the Weeping Tower. It is a wooden structure with tiered defensive platforms overhanging the walls, and its great height coupled with an unstable foundation has caused it to slump to one side. House Whitehead has their seat here. Down by the docks, a number of inns service travellers with rooms, sour ale, and sourer wenches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_mistwood;Mistwood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_mistwood_desc;Deep within the Rainwood between the Weeping Town and Rain House is Mistwood, a short stone-and-timber square keep that is dominated by an immense round tower rising out of its open, central courtyard called the Tower of Owls. The very top of it reaches into the low-hanging clouds that roll like a foggy sea above the canopy of rainwood trees, which are giants in their own right. A rookery and private lord's solar are found here, with barracks and the bedchambers of House Mertyns down beneath. Instead of external watchtowers, a network of rope and plank bridges span across the trunks of trees surrounding the keep, also granting clear sight of some neighboring farmland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_rain_house;Rain House;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_rain_house_desc;Rain House is the shield of Shipbreaker Bay and the eastern Rainwood, a vital point of contention for any invading force. It is not so much a house as a military stronghold, reinforced throughout the ages by House Wylde. Its yellowish sandstone walls are built from the protruding cliffside that it rests upon, with corner spires granting full view of a natural cove and small shipyard. During tidal shifts, dangerous whirlpools threaten to sink boats and small ships passing by, and the tops of the spires are lit at these times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_greenstone;Greenstone;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_greenstone_desc;Greenstone is the only fortification of any note on the remote isle of Estermont, situated on a mountainous ridgeline along the spine of the land. It is a steep climb and quite cramped, but the position is prime for swift warning of any impending assault. The walls and rectangular keep are constructed of an iridescent emerald-shaded stone found nowhere else, which has been dulled to a pale green by intense storms charging in from the Narrow Sea. Down by the shore is a narrow inlet with enough space to shelter docks, a small fleet, and a garrisoned wooden watch tower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_evenfall;Evenfall Hearth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_evenfall_desc;Tarth is an island off the eastern coast of Westeros, also known as the Sapphire Isle for the striking blue sea in which it sits. The interior is a place of beauty, having abundant waterfalls, soaring mountains, high meadows, and shadowed vales. It is also a source of marble, a valuable export, and the principal decorative material used for pillars and flooring in the great hall of Evenfall Hearth, a coastal stronghold of colossal size that is the seat of House Tarth. The head of this Andal family is known as the Evenstar, a tradition dating back to the dawn of days. \n\nThe castle's exterior stands proud and tall, jutting right up to the edge of a precipitous cliff of jagged rocks. There is a low outer wall and a much higher main wall with double towers in each of its four corners, and a trio of turrets above the central keep linked by an elevated, arched walkway. A steep, hidden stairwell leads down through the dungeon to a hollow cavern with a chained boat and locked iron grate, accessible but unseen by sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_old_oak;Old Oak;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_old_oak_desc;Old Oak is an ancient castle along the Searoad, south of Crakehall. It is the seat of House Oakheart, an old noble line descending from Garth Greenhand, mythical high king of the First Men. The castle hunkers behind a tall curtain wall, a dry moat, and dual gates leading under a barbican. Inside the courtyard can be found shade beneath branching oaks and a cool dip in shallow pools, and a small temple with stairs going down to the fastidiously maintained Oakheart crypt. The main keep has pointed conical corner towers, an open balcony extending from the uppermost floor, and a large great hall with green and gold banners hanging from wooden support beams. Murals of the family's esteemed history are visible throughout.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_goldengrove;Goldengrove;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_goldengrove_desc;Goldengrove is a place of serene natural beauty, with sun-drenched fields and orchards stretching across the land and a gentle river flowing through it. It is the home of House Rowan, who trace their ancestry back through Rowan Gold-Tree to Garth Greenhand. According to legend, she was so bereft when her lover left her for a rich rival that she wrapped an apple in her golden hair and planted it upon a hill. From the apple grew a tree whose bark, leaves and fruit were yellow gold. \n\nThe castle defending this realm is situated beside the riverfront, where willows droop and sway in the breeze. It is small in stature but well-constructed, garrisoned by spirited soldiers and knights drawn from the countryside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_grassy_vale;Grassfield Keep;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_grassy_vale_desc;Grassy Vale sits along the northern shore of the Blueburn river, in the lowland valley just past its source in the hills. Intense patches of many-colored wildflowers grace the verdant soil here, the likes of which are emblazoned upon House Meadows'coat of arms, who rule from their seat of Grassfield Keep. It is a two-storied building with stately gardens and a large iron-gated private grounds separating it from the two villages it lies between. The first floor is stone, housing the stables, larder, and servants'quarters, and on the rustic timbered second floor is a hall, bedchambers, and lord's study.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonebridge;Stonebridge;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stonebridge_desc;Stonebridge is situated where the Roseroad crosses the Mander, taking its name from the old stone bridge curving upward over the rough, muddy waters. Only shallow boatcraft can navigate here, and fording is unwise. House Caswell presides over toll collection and more lordly duties from their castle, which has a squat stone-and-timber framework, seeming taller than it is from the flat, low-lying terrain. Despite its diminutive height, its battlements are broad and unyielding, and it serves as an important bastion and tactical choke point against any invading force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_longtable;Longtable;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_longtable_desc;Longtable stretches north to south along the river Mander near its confluence with the Blueburn, just south of Stone Bridge. As with many areas of the Reach, it is a bounteous land based on agriculture and supporting a large populace, which has historically conferred substantial wealth to House Merryweather. Their traditional seat is a long, rectangular keep built of mortared rocks hoisted from the riverbed, mottled grey and brown and stacked three stories high. The outer wall is rather low by comparison, but reinforced with a steep earthen trench. Entering through the gatehouse, the path is lined by gardens where fruits both foreign and native ripen solely for the lord's pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tumbleton;Tumbleton;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tumbleton_desc;Tumbleton is a major population center and prosperous inland town of the Reach, sprawling out across both sides of the Mander near its headsprings. As the largest settlement in the Northmarch, which borders frequently hostile neighbors, it has been a target of attack throughout its history, leading to full encirclement by an outer wall and progressive reinforcement of Footly Keep, a stout but small castle with a garrison of well-drilled archers, pikemen, and mounted outriders. \n\nThe town itself is a crowded place, filled with merchants hawking wares from brightly-colored stalls and pavilions in the cobbled market square, which is shadowed by the Tumbletower, a tall but crudely wrought structure where prisoners are held and executed, often by taking a tumble from above with a noose and left to hang upon the wall, reminding onlookers about the rule of law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_honeyholt;Honeyholt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_honeyholt_desc;Honeyholt is a fertile land that has been occupied since the dawn age, situated along the eastern bank of the languid, slow-moving Honeywine river between Oldtown and Brightwater Keep. This entire region is considered the agricultural capital of the Reach. Seated here in Honeyholt is House Beesbury, an old family with a history of bee-keeping dating back to its founder. \n\nThey command this section of the Honeywine from their castle by the river, separated from an adjacent village by a long drawbridge and deep moat, with high stone walls of a chalky white hue that gleam in the sun. There are many apiaries in the wildflower-rich fields and orchards, which also support a booming trade in mead, the finest of which is exported or kept in the lord's private stock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_bandallon;Bandallon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_bandallon_desc;Bandallon is a castle keep at the confluence of a northern branch of the Honeywine river that empties into the nearby Sunset Sea. Having suffered far-ranging Ironborn raids that slipped past the Shield Islands to the north, it was fortified as a major stronghold for the area, with an iron-barred portcullis and circular outer walls, the battlements of which are machicolated and reinforced by three flanking towers. \n\nThe inner keep was originally a dilapidated two-storied manse - it was later renovated and had a third floor added by House Blackbar, with a large candle-lit sept enclosed by an arrow-slitted walkway. The first floor was then converted to barracks, and in between are the private chambers and feast hall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_blackcrown;Blackcrown;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_blackcrown_desc;Blackcrown is a castle of dark stone, resting atop a sloping hill at the edge of an estuary on the north shore of the Whispering Sound, with its brackish water, wading birds, and flocks of gulls. The castle is resident to House Bulwer, a noble family descended from Garth Greenhand through his mighty son, Bors the Breaker. According to legend, Bors gained the strength of twenty men by drinking only bull's blood. Some tales state that he grew a pair of black horns from this. \n\nIn any case, Blackcrown is a vital point defending the rich farmland nearby, where milk cows graze, and fire plums and fortified plum wines are produced in copious amount. Together with the Three Towers across the bay, it has also served as an auxiliary fortress guarding against hostile approach to Oldtown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_three_towers;Three Towers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_three_towers_desc;Sitting astride a prominent cliff on the southern shore of the Whispering Sound, Three Towers is a defensible walled fortress with a gargantuan trio of towers, one of which serves as the central keep. The two others reinforce both western corners overlooking the shoreline, imposing trebuchets assembled atop them denying seaborne assault. Ballistae line the wall facing the east, bolts peeking out between the crenellations ready to brutally impale attackers climbing the hillside approach. \n\nHouse Costayne has their seat here, sworn to Oldtown and guarding it alongside Blackcrown across the bay. The land is densely populated and overflowing with agricultural productivity, which supported Three Towers'construction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_sunhouse;Sunhouse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_sunhouse_desc;Sunhouse is the most southerly Reach stronghold on the mainland of Westeros, situated east of the Redwyne Straits and west of the Torrentine's mouth in borderlands that have witnessed numerous incursions from Dorne throughout history. No doubt invaders are envious of the wide plains, ripe crops, and swaying sunflower fields pressed for their valuable oil. The sunflower lends its form to House Cuy's coat of arms, and its name to Sunflower Hall, the ornately decorated great hall within Sunhouse full of colorful paintings, marble statues, and a plush velvet carpet of blue and yellow leading to the Sunflower Seat - a ceremonial wicker chair on a dais where the lord receives audience. \n\nBeyond tall sandstone walls and spires erected in the Dornish style by a former occupying force, the town of Cuy sprawls all the way to sea, a hub of trade and stopping point for vessels on route to Oldtown or The Arbor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_blackmont;Blackmont;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_blackmont_desc;Blackmont is a castle perched on a peak overlooking the village below, like the great black vulture emblazoned upon House Blackmont's coat of arms. It lies on the eastern banks of the Torrentine river, where rushing rapids and rocky canyons stretch south towards Starfall, and is considered a bastion of The Vulture faith within the Red Mountains. The walls and watchtowers are built of brown sandstone, and the lofty keep is roofed with a darker shade of slate. From this point of power, many raids have been launched into the Dornish Marches and beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_high_hermitage;High Hermitage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_high_hermitage_desc;High Hermitage lies directly north of Starfall and was founded as a monastic retreat with its own septry, in the craggy highlands of the Red Mountains. Intended for quiet contemplation and simple living, it experienced repeated attacks during marcher conflicts and has fallen under the protection of various lords of the Faith who reinforced it with a formidable outer bulwark. Tended olives grow outside under intense sun, gnarled and dusty, while the septry and inner grounds are housed halfway beneath an overhanging canyon, where some buildings are carved right out of the rock face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_kingsgrave;Kingsgrave;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_kingsgrave_desc;Follow the Wide Way south of Skysreach, past the Prince's Pass, and you will come to King's Grave. This is where the founder of House Manwoody slew a king of the Reach in ages past, and the whole area derives its name from this notorious act. \n\nDown the slope of a mountainside on a level field is found the castle, square in shape and tan in color, with tiled red roofs on its conical spires. A broad cloth pavilion is staked into the courtyard, where smallfolk from nearby villages bring tribute to the lord. Itinerant shepherds and their sheep are found along the sweet meadowland of a nearby river, which flows east to Yronwood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vulture_keep;Vulture Keep;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vulture_keep_desc;Vulture's Roost is an ancient stronghold of The Vulture faith, near the source of the river Wyl deep in the Red Mountains. The air here is crisp, cold at night, and strong winds blow dust through. Broken stones dot the landscape, and a harsh sun beats down onto bleached white bones picked clean by carrion birds. \n\nSome fertile land is found by the waterside, however, and the redstone keep of the Vulture's Roost guards it from atop a western hillock. It is a squat and stout thing, mortared by mud and crumbling in places, but it is a defensible location and reinforced by dry outer trenches. Fallen men lie in piles here, desiccated and contorted into frightful poses from their moments of death, ready to cast doubt upon the hearts of any whom approach with ill intent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ghaston_grey;Ghaston Grey;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ghaston_grey_desc;Alone in the Sea of Dorne is the arid isle of Ghaston Grey. It is a small, bleak place with an old fortress carved from greyish sandstone and topped by rusting iron spikes along its battlements. The Grey Tower prison here is most notorious, where criminals are sent by neighboring kingdoms to rot into dust and bone. The lord receives just compensation for this, which sustains his family, a meager garrison, and the squalid sustenance of its shackled forsaken men. Beauty is found only in the distant sky during sunset, where many shades of purple, red, and pink greet the azure water at its horizon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_sandstone;Sandstone;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_sandstone_desc;Sandstone was settled by Andal adventurers who ventured into the deep dunes and sands, east of Starfall and west of Hellholt. Prominent among them was House Qorgoyle, who fortified the only well around for fifty leagues by constructing defensive walls around both it and a pale sandstone keep. The grated front gate is typically open to smallfolk and weary travelers, who gather from it for their needs under the watchful gaze of household guards. A small village sprawls from the gate entrance outward towards a seasonally dry stream, the mud bottom cracked and fissured by heat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_hellholt;Hellholt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_hellholt_desc;Hellholt is a grim castle that stinks from the warm, sulphurous waters of the river Brimstone, which flows south from its mountain source and empties into the Summer Sea. The castle rests by its embankment, sloping down the mountainside from a crest overlooking the endless sands. The outer wall follows the water before curving away, forming a narrow rectangular courtyard with towers at each corner. \n\nA dusty path leads from the bottom gatehouse upward to the ridgeline and the lord's keep, a tall square structure built by House Uller from an unsightly, pitted mixture of yellow sandstone and brown rock, with arrow slits and claw-shaped balconies on the second floor. Pleasant to gaze upon, it is not, but only the foolhardy doubt its strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaith;Vaith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vaith_desc;The Vaiths built a tall and pale castle in the hills east of the restless dunes of Dorne, in a prime location to control one of the two tributary waterways feeding the great Greenblood river. It is considered their principal seat and a major Dornish stronghold, its construction aided by lucrative trade in the populous town that grew outside its walls, where dyes, silks, and other luxuries exchange hands in the colorful market square. \n\nGuardsmen patrol with scimitar and spear, ready to break up trouble or man the battlements against assault. Swift sand steeds are also bred here, whinnying from the stables, and travelers may rest by fragrant gardens with fountains and marble pillars in imitation of the famous Water Gardens near Sunspear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_salt_shore;Salt Shore;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_salt_shore_desc;Salt Shore is a region in southern Dorne stretching along the coast of the Summer Sea, where fishing boats with their billowing sails harvest from the warm waters and larger trading vessels are spotted in the distance. Smallfolk may be found piling pinkish salt along the shore and hauling it off for trade. Further inland and set upon a rocky windswept cliffside is a round sandstone keep with an open inner courtyard shaded by date palms, and decorative geometric patterns carved into the walls. \n\nThere is an interior walkway circling the entire second floor, and many shuttered windows from which bowmen may loose arrows and the surrounding land can be viewed. Sun-faded banners hang from exterior wooden structural planks, showcasing the heraldry of House Gargalen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_godsgrace;Godsgrace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_godsgrace_desc;Godsgrace is an important stronghold sitting near the junction of the Greenblood river, right along the shore where walls extend deep into the water. There is a large open area in between to receive supplies during siege, with twin docks following the walls before ending at fortified stone watchtowers, barnacles clinging to their base. Should hostile ships be lured in, hidden chains are dredged up from the riverbed here to entrap them. The tall, rectangular main keep is pushed up against the landward northern wall, jutting above it, and a gatehouse riddled with murder holes tunnels directly beneath. This is the seat of House Allyrion, and in their own words, no foe may pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_lemonwood;Lemonwood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_lemonwood_desc;Lemonwood lies south across the Greenblood from Planky Town, near the river's mouth. Lemon, lime, and blood orange trees thrive in the sandy loam soil here, which is irrigated by a spider's web of thin canals. They are able to withstand the heat that would wither other plants, providing a valuable resource to the people here. \n\nAmong the many orchards is Lemonwood Manor, a small square building that is the seat of House Dalt and decorated in the Dornish style. The hall is noteworthy for an ornately carved wooden throne chair, where smallfolk entreat the lord's favor and seek dispute resolution after ceremonially scattering sweet-smelling blossoms at his feet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_the_tor;The Tor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_the_tor_desc;The Tor is a traditional seat of Dornish kings from House Jordayne, ruling from a triangular sandstone castle situated on the bare ridgeline of a rocky mountain chain that follows the Greenblood inland. Sight of both the river and northern coastline is possible here on clear days, and surprise assault by foreign armies is nigh impossible while controlling The Tor. \n\nIt is of substantial strategic importance for this reason, and has been fortified in recognition of this - the walls are thick, supporting a trio of tall flanking spires at each point. These are manned by watchmen and a contingent of archers. A ditch has also impressively been dug from the hard soil and lined with spikes, completed by a drawbridge and narrow gatehouse where a few ranks of spearmen can repel a far larger force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_plankytown;Planky Town;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_plankytown_desc;The Greenblood circulates most trade within eastern Dorne, and Planky Town is its pumping heart, located west of Sunspear near the river's mouth. Merchants from across the Narrow Sea do business at the harbor, where barges small and large are lashed to a jumbled network of docks. Some are permanently tied up and anchored, converted to homes and businesses. It is thus a swelling mass of people and activity, and travel by pole boat is a common alternative to walking. \n\nDuring celebrations, sour Dornish red wine flows as freely as the Greenblood, there are cheers over competitive games of cyvasse, and song carries across the water. Commanding this boisterous town is the Creaky Keep, a hulking wooden fortress that watches over the floating market square from land, holding a respectably sized garrison, a great hall, and lordly quarters above.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ghost_hill;Ghost Hill;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ghost_hill_desc;Ghost Hill is a castle of chalk-white walls, shining against the deep blue of the Sea of Dorne. It is near the top of a gently sloping hill, walled off from a small town that spreads all the way down to the base. While historically possessing few resources besides sparse hardwoods, some rudimentary agriculture, and the haul of nearby fisherfolk, it has importance as a sea to caravan route less vulnerable to piracy from the Stepstones, which many ship captains are disinclined to risk. Traversing the dryland and desert is thus a fair tradeoff on the way to Planky Town or Sunspear. \n\nAnother unique aspect of this area is the presence of numerous slot canyons, the soil so compacted that it floods from rare rains. These are locally rumored to be haunted by ghostly specters of the drowned, their wails bemoaning such an unexpected death in this parched land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_spotswood;Spotswood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_spotswood_desc;Spotswood was first settled by the Santagars, adventuring Andals who stumbled upon a precious spring feeding into a sheltered coastal lagoon occupied by Stepstone pirates. In gratitude to the gods after victoriously driving them off, the springhead was enshrined by a resplendent seven-pointed sept walled and tiled with polished pale sandstone. From this same material was built their small but stout keep, which oversees the lagoon that now serves as a stopping point to and from the Greenblood. \n\nFurther inland is a great copse of yew trees, the material fashioned into longbows of superior quality by local craftsmen. Taking advantage of this, a tradition of archery was established, and some of the finest bowmen in Dorne are trained here to serve the lord, or alternatively as valuable mercenaries elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_glimmering;Tower of Glimmering;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_glimmering_desc;The Tower of Glimmering sits on back of a rotund seaside crag crumbling away from the perpetual smashing of waves into the dark, serrated rock. An open abandoned pit may be found nearby, where once a paler workable limestone was excavated by thrall labor. The fat drum-shaped tower is built from this material, which contrasts against the barren point upon which it rests. \n\nNorth and south along the flatter sections of coastline are sod-roofed huts of fishing villages, and west are the open moors. Stacks of peat are sliced from the soil there and dried to fuel sooty hearths from the cold. Lacking even meager farms, some hardwood groves are carefully managed for longship production, sustaining continuous reaving of the vulnerable riverland that lies less than a day's journey east.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ten_towers;Ten Towers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ten_towers_desc;Situated on the sloping hillside of a peninsula on the northeastern edge of Harlaw Isle, a monstrous mass of stone has been upended from the earth into a set of ten towers, all of varying size and shape - some round and low, others square and strong, and a few so slender and tall that they dare the Storm God to strike them down. \n\nEach of these is linked by a maze of arched walkways and covered bridges, and at the center is the Book Tower, an octagonal giant made of large block stones and which boasts one of the finest libraries in Westeros at its summit. From this vantage, the wind howls all around, and there is full view of the Long Stone Quay, a feat of masonry plowing deep into the sea between two towers flanking it from shore. Fishing is excellent there, and ships sidle up to it as Harlawn raiders who've paid the iron price haul in their plunder to the main hall, where crossed scythes of beaten silver hang above the high seat of their powerful house.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_harlaw_hill;Harlaw Hall;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_harlaw_hill_desc;Among the most ancient of castles on the Iron Islands, Harlaw Hall was designed principally for its defensive capability, with a concentric ring of stonework denying access to the crest of a hill and the plain square keep that sits upon it. Besides the spacious great hall, which takes up the entire first floor, it is a rather modestly sized fortification by Ironborn standards and suffers from cramped, dank quarters prone to nitre buildup. Despite this, it has prestige as the ancestral seat of House Harlaw, and the benefit of productive mines for lead, tin, and iron, transported for trade and refinement by shaggy ponies used throughout the island that are renowned for their endurance whilst navigating the stony terrain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_langaanes;Langaanes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_langaanes_desc;Langaanes is an especially low-lying settlement spanning across a long, narrow isthmus between the sea and a freshwater lake large enough that the other side is scarcely visible - a rarity for the Iron Islands. Located nearest Castamere and the coastline of the Westerlands, longships returning from reaving traditionally found haven here before moving on. Frequently overloaded with captives, a dubious slave trade was developed by House Codd, totally anathema to the Ironborn value of refusing the gold price for thralls. \n\nDue to extensive admixture of Westermen and Ironborn blood, and several major thrall rebellions, Langaanes' reputation was tarnished. It is commonly considered a place of thieves, cowards, and wanton women. The people carry on, however, bolstered in number by fertile farmland and a growing harbor, all while traditionalists vow that the Drowned God will swallow them into the depths during a great reckoning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_lordsport;Lordsport;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_lordsport_desc;Lordsport is the largest town in the Iron Islands, possessing a natural harbor that provides safe anchor to hundreds of vessels, including those wishing to reach the fortress of Pyke. Its many docks dip into the chilling water like swarthy fingers, and the shore is reinforced against rough storms by embankments of stone. There is an everpresent beating of anvils from forges producing excellent swords, axes, mail, and plate - twangs and thuds of hammer on metal carry over all the cut thatch roofs of timber and wattle homes that crowd in around the harbor and up a steep cobbled street to the stronghold of House Botley, their pale green banners drooping from its squat corner towers. Beyond a low wall, the main keep is a towering behemoth built of the same timber and wattle construction, unusual for bucking the trend of reserving most wood for ships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_lonely_light;Lonely Light;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_lonely_light_desc;At the western limit of the known world, the red glow of Lonely Light's flame may be seen atop an old stone roundtower enclosed by decaying outer walls clinging to a level plateau, reachable only by a switchback trail carved from the cliffside. The island is a tiny one, part of a meager chain of glorified reefs and rocks ruled by House Farwynd. It is rumored that they can take the form of sea lions, walruses and spotted whales, their only neighbors besides seabirds. Others say that they are prone to madness, owing to extreme isolation. In any case, their land is a true backwater leagues away from civilization, its primary asset being shallow shoals where ships may safely rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_pebbleton;Pebbleton;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_pebbleton_desc;South from Hammerhorn across a shallow inlet, the hovels of a fishing village are strewn along the pebbled shore of a sheltered cove, just beyond the reach of high tide. Smooth, water worn stones make up the walls of most structures here, stacked up and mortared by a combination of mud and manure. At the center of this community is an open courtyard, a well, and Pebbleton Tower, the large square towerhouse seated by House Merlyn watching over the populace. Turrets rise from each corner, and families traditionally bring a collection of new stone each year, adding to its height with their combined labor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_naggas_hill;Grey King's Hall;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_naggas_hill_desc;Behold the sacred hill where the petrified ribs of Nagga, a dead sea dragon, rise from the ground like large white trees as wide as a dromond's mast and twice as tall. These are the beams and pillars of the Grey King's Hall, and her jaws the throne. According to legend, the Hall had been warmed by Nagga's living fire, and on the walls hung tapestries made of silver seaweed. The men sworn to the Grey King ate at a table shaped like a large starfish while seated on thrones made from mother-of-pearl. Upon the Grey King's death, the Storm God snuffed out Nagga's fire and the sea stole the throne. \n\nThis is where Kingsmoots historically occur, Ironborn captains putting forth their names as candidates, one to rule the land as Rock King, and another over the sea as Salt King. Support is swayed by personal combat, eloquent speech, generous gifts, or simply the size of one's fleet at anchor in the bay of Nagga's Cradle - feasting tents are raised between the tideline there and Nagga's Hill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_shatterstone;Shatterstone;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_shatterstone_desc;On the edge of Old Wyk's western peninsula is the fortress of Shatterstone, where Ironmen of old raised a tall earthen mound and set blackened stones upon its crown in the form of a colossal D-shaped keep, ringed by low walls and facing the east. Stories passed from wise crones and priests of the Drowned God speak of a legendary battle against his Storm God rival, when the spine of the island was broken and crushed down from its former height, rock and ash sent spewing leagues away to bury all in their wake. \n\nMiners in the cruel, windy hills occasionally report rubble and even preserved victims cast to stone in fetal poses, and there are those who say the war is not yet finished. From their Shatterstone seat, House Drumm and the surrounding townsfolk stand ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_drumm_tower;Drumm Tower;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_drumm_tower_desc;Similar to Shatterstone to the north, Drumm Tower is built of a black rock dispersed across the island. It is a relatively short round structure, but broad in girth and large enough to serve as a proper keep for a lord. It functions as a watchtower across the southerly waters, and guardian over a grove grown exclusively for warship production. \n\nYounger sons of the Drumm family are bestowed command here, which is a holy place for their lineage. An overgrown path meanders downhill to burial mounds and a ring of standing stones, hinting at their First Men lineage before the Drowned God's embrace. It is also rumored that a dead Drumm practiced necromantical magics at this site, and locals put fear into their children with tales of a lich warlock stealing those who misbehave, to sacrificially carve out their still-beating hearts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_hammerhorn;Hammerhorn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_hammerhorn_desc;Above the main entrance to a series of ore mines and excavated caves is the bulky square castle of Hammerhorn, with its iron spikes looming imposingly over the battlements. The stonework used for its construction was quarried by thralls from the cliff directly behind it, a feat of substantial cost and toil. The halls within are full of shadows, dank and drafty from the seaborne winds sweeping up and over the ridgeline, and the sullen hearth fires are said to give off more smoke than heat. \n\nIt is a decidedly inland fortress, rare for the Iron Islands, and the way up to the front gate is a rough one along a trail so narrow as to be unsafe for horses. Despite these troubles, it oversees the most productive extraction of mineral wealth in the region, as well as a busy harbour town in the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_crow_spike_keep;Crow Spike Keep;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_crow_spike_keep_desc;Among the humblest of House Goodbrother's holdings is their old seat of Crow Spike Keep, a lone tower rising from within the western limits of the Hardstone Hills, where the island's backbone tapers into flatter terrain. Originally overseeing a fishing village razed by war, the decrepit husks of homes were stripped of their stone and used to reinforce the tower's base, which now houses a defensive garrison protecting part of a fleet tethered in the bay, some ships undergoing repairs while beached on the sandy shore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_blacktyde;Blacktyde;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_blacktyde_desc;One of the northernmost isles of the Iron Islands is Blacktyde, with its eponymous castle situated on a rocky seaside ledge watching out over the rugged southerly coast. The walls are comprised of solid grey stone, as is the central keep, a long rectangular two-floored structure following the cliff's edge. Beneath it are tidal pools and a hollow where rushing waters pour in, roaring and spraying sea mist high into the air. The shipyard harboring House Blacktyde's longships is a short walk from here, accessible by pulley from the courtyard and guarded by garrisoned auxiliary towers. \n\nNotorious for extremely distant raids and the taking of salt wives from the wine lands of the Reach, the people here are noted for their mixed Westerosi complexion bred in over many generations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_sealskin_point;Sealskin Point;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_sealskin_point_desc;Primary seat of House Farwynd, Sealskin Point is the origin of the family's far-flung cadet branches. As the name suggests, it is home to an abundance of seals, using this sparsely populated land as their breeding ground. Some consider the people here to be most queer, with skinchanger's blood coursing through their veins, and the Farwynd lords are worse accused of heretical Storm God worship. No matter the rumors suffered, theirs is a proud line, ruling from one of the few wooden great halls on the isles, square-shaped and slope-roofed, and defended by a staked perimeter. The hearth is warm, full of fur-lined benches round the fire, with carven masks of snarling beasts hung as decoration, and the throne chair is of polished bone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_winterfell;Winterfell;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_winterfell_desc;To the descendants of the First Men Winterfell is not just a castle, it is a legend. It was supposedly built by Brandon the Builder over eight thousand years ago with the help of giants and for most of recorded history has been the seat of House Stark. \n\nIt is positioned over hot springs that not only provide a continuous supply of fresh water, but also heats the castle and its environs through even the harshest winter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_storms_end;Storm's End;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_storms_end_desc;One of the strongest castles in the realm, Storm's End was once the ancestral seat of the Storm Kings of House Durrandon extending back many thousands of years. The castle is said to be protected by spells woven into its very walls that prevent magic from affecting it or passing through it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_eyrie;The Eyrie;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_eyrie_desc;The Eyrie is an ancient castle and seat of House Arryn, one of the oldest lines of Andal nobility, within the Vale of Arryn. It is situated in the Mountains of the Moon astride the peak known as the Giant's Lance, several thousand feet above the valley below. Although small compared to the seats of other Great Houses in Westeros, the Eyrie is considered impregnable to attack. Its construction was started by Roland Arryn. \n\nDuring winter years, the Arryns seek refuge against the cold at the base of the mountain in the Gates of the Moon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_casterly_rock;Casterly Rock;Castral Roc;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_casterly_rock_desc;Casterly Rock, the fortress is carved out of a great stone hill and its natural defenses are further enhanced with walls and other structures. It is tunneled through with halls and chambers, with a huge keep at its peak. It is the second-largest castle in the realm with some of the strongest defenses in the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_hightower;The Hightower;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_hightower_desc;The Hightower stands tall in the center of Oldtown. It is a massive stepped tower with a beacon on top to guide ships into port. It is the tallest structure in the Seven Kingdoms and some claim that the Wall can be seen from its top.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_orkmont;Orkmont;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_orkmont_desc;Settled by an alliance of Andal warlords that deposed a driftwood king and dispossessed House Greyiron of their birth home, the Hoares of the black blood rose to prominence by allegedly winning the finger dance against Rognar II, seizing Orkmont Castle as their prize and losing only two fingers in the process. This granted them a bare brute of a fortress, situated above a bowl-shaped valley on the hillside, the lower portion flooded as a salt marsh during high tide. The island's landscape as a whole is barren, having been stripped of its forests long ago, and the Hoares rely on a blend of ore extraction, astute trade, savage raids, and permanent conquest against richer domains. Their sigil represents these varied historical holdings, all bound by iron chains.;;;;;;;x;;;;;;x
ca_eastwatch;Eastwatch-By-The-Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;x;x
ca_eastwatch_desc;Eastwatch-by-the-Sea is the easternmost castle along the Wall, located on a grey, windswept shore by the Bay of Seals. The Night's Watch keeps several galleys at Eastwatch, including larger vessels capable of crossing the narrow sea and lean fighting vessels. The galleys patrol the Bay of Seals in part to catch smugglers who trade weapons to the wildlings.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;x
ca_oldstones;Oldstones;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_oldstones_desc;Oldstones sits on a hill above the Blue Fork of the Trident. The curtain wall of Oldstones encircles the brow of the hill upon which it sits, like the crown on a king's head. Beneath the castle, the lower slopes of the hill are thickly forested. There are gorse, bracken, thistle, sedge and blackberry bushes between pines and grey-green sentinels. Elsewhere skeletal elm, ash and scrub oaks choke the ground like weeds.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;x
ca_highgarden;Highgarden;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_highgarden_desc;Highgarden is surrounded by three rings of white stone whose walls increase in height. Between the outer and middle walls is a famous briar labyrinth which serves to entertain as well as slow invaders. The oldest towers, squat and square, from the Age of Heroes. Newer towers are tall and slender, round fortifications dating from after the Andal invasion. Also within Highgarden's walls are groves, fountains, and courtyards. The castle's godswood contains three weirwoods known as the Three Singers. The palatial keep is decorated with statues and colonnades.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,;x
ca_nightfort;Nightfort;;;;;;;;;;;x;;x
ca_nightfort_desc;The Nightfort is the largest and oldest castle of the Night's Watch along the Wall, and the only one whose steps up the side of the Wall were carved into the ice. It sits between Icemark to the west and Deep Lake to the east. The castle has been rebuilt hundreds of times.\n\n The Nightfort does not offer the watch as much space to hold men, but gives a much higher fort level than other castles of the Watch. This does come at a higher price though, since the maintenance to keep the castle in good shape is more taxing.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;x
ca_castle_black;Castle Black;;;;;;;;;;;x;;x
ca_castle_black_desc;Castle Black is the main stronghold of the Night's Watch and the seat of their Lord Commander. The castle is situated along the Wall between Queensgate to the west and Oakenshield to the east, near the center of the Wall. Castle Black is not a true castle, as it has no walls to defend it to the west, east, or south. Only the Wall stands to the north. It consists of several stone towers and timber keeps. Beneath the keeps and towers, there is a series of subterranean passages called wormwalks which connect all of the buildings.\n\n This unique castle can only be built once its requirements are met. Castle Black was a large project that took hundreds of years to build, and is not available at game start.;;;;;;;;;;;x;;x
ca_dragonstone;Dragonstone;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_dragonstone_desc;Dragonstone is a castle located on the island of the same name at the entrance to Blackwater Bay. Located below the Dragonmont and shaped from stone to look like dragons. The castle has a dark reputation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
