ERA_CHAR_INFO_7803;When Prince Roland, the heir to the Kingdom of the Mountain and Vale invited Lord Waymar to the Gates of the moon, Waymar was skeptical at first. Tensions between the Arryns and Royces had never been this high since the time of Robar Royce and Artys Arryn. Eventually Waymar gave in and traveled to the foot of the Mountain of the Moon. For seven nights they feasted and jousted, on the seventh night however, treachery. Prince Roland had all of the Royces arrested and tried on charges of treason. They were all executed in front of the Bloody Gate. When King Osric heard of this he was outraged, he even went as far to threaten to send the Crown Prince to the wall. However, when Andar Royce raised his banners in rebellion there was nothing the just King could do. He would protect his family and destroy the Royce pretender once and for all. As High as Honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_605;King Tristifer IV Mudd, also known as the Hammer of Justice, was the fourth King of the Rivers and the Hills to bear that name. He raised the castle that became known as Oldstones, the strongest in Westeros at the time of its construction. With the Andal invaders to the south, Tristifer must find allies where he can. His situation is truly desperate, yet the Hammer does not flee. To the west Euron Ironman invades, thinking himself the rightful King of the Riverlands. Tristifer will teach this usurper the true meaning of justice. Tristifer must strike down his enemies ruthlessly if he hopes to lead his people to a tomorrow rid of the Andal scourge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1216;Mern III Gardener, called the Madling, was a King of the Reach and head of House Gardener. Before the Andals came to the Reach, he showered gold and honors on a woods witch who boasted she could raise armies of the dead to fight off the invaders. During Mern's many fits of madness his vassals gained much power. His Marshals now rule as semi-autonomous Kings. Perhaps Mern's son Prince Garth can end this conflict once and for all. Garth must be weary however, Andal incursions have been spotted from the east and south. All Reachmen have heard of the savagery of the invaders. Yet perhaps a bloodless solution can be found through alliances and marriages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1800;Maldon IV Durrandon was a Storm King of House Durrandon. During the Andal invasion of the stormlands, as neither side defeated the other, Maldon took an Andal maiden as his wife. Durran XXIV was born of this union. However, many of the Lords of the Stormlands disapprove of this match causing many to proclaim themselves Kings. Maldon must take action or his Storm Kingdom may well collapse. Ours is the Fury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_400;Tyrion III Lannister was a King of the Rock from House Lannister of Casterly Rock. As the Andals began moving into the westerlands in larger numbers than in the time of Tybolt the Thunderbolt, Tyrion decided to arrange marriages for the more powerful Andal warchiefs with the daughters of the great houses of the west. Aware of Andal betrayals in the Vale, he also took the sons and daughters of the new Andal lords as wards and fosterlings to serve as pages and cupbearers, as well as hostages, at Casterly Rock. However, King Tyrion has not converted to the Faith of The Seven personally. Hear me Roar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_203;King Brandon once called a lowly wildling bard a coward. To take revenge of this affront and prove his courage, the bard, named Bael, climbed the Wall and traveled to Winterfell. There, he sang until midnight for the King. Impressed by his skills as a singer, King Brandon asked him what he wanted as a reward, Bael asked only for the most beautiful flower blooming in Winterfell's gardens. King Brandon accepted, and gave Bael the most beautiful blue winter rose in the Winterfell gardens. But the following morning, the single, virgin daughter of the King vanished without a trace, and in her bed was the blue winter rose. Lord Brandon sent the members of the Night's Watch looking for them beyond the Wall, but neither Bael nor the girl were found. Some months later the girl was found in her room, holding at her breast- an infant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

GARTH_GARDENER;Garth VIII Gardener;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1217;Garth VIII Gardener was a King of the Reach and head of House Gardener. Along with his son and grandson, he is remembered as one of the Three Sage Kings who dealt with the Andal invasion of the Reach with a policy of accord and assimilation rather then armed resistance.Instead of fighting off the Andals, Garth IX brought a septon to his court and made him part of his councils. The first sept at Highgarden was built during Garth's reign, although he continued to worship the old gods. He took Andals into his service as household knights and retainers, and bequeathed lands and wives and lordships for the more powerful of the Andal kings and other Andal adventurers descending on the Reach in exchange for pledges of fealty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_9520;The young Qhored sacked Oldtown, taking thousands of women as captives. When he was thirty, Qhored defeated King Bernarr II Justman and took his three sons as hostages. Three years later he murdered the boys in the Bloody Keep of Pyke, crushed Bernarr's vengeful army, and drowned the river king as a sacrifice to the Drowned God, putting an end to House Justman. During the reign of King Qhored, the ironborn could rightfully claim that his writ ran "wherever men can smell salt water or hear the crash of waves." The ironborn were at their peak of expansion, ruling territory along the Sunset Sea from the Arbor to Bear Island. Many men abandoned the shores for fear of Qhored's reavers, while those who remained were forced to pay tribute. The Kingdom of the Reach called him Qhored the Cruel. King Qhored died at the age of ninety, having ruled for seventy five years. Qhored's conquests were gradually lost by his successors and descendents, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_9607;Known as 'the Clever,' Lann was able to swindle the Lordship of Casterly Rock from its previous owner, the Casterly's. While the way in which he achieved this magnificent feat is forever lost, it is none the less impressive. Lann now lives atop the beautiful mountain, now the richest man in Westeros. He has taken the last member of the Casterly line, Leana, as his wife. This is but the beginning however, many lords surrounding Casterly Rock distrust and hate the new golden haired Lord. If he is to succeed he must be careful and use his infamous wit to its most extent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_5121;According to legend, Durran won the love of Elenei, the daughter of the sea god and the goddess of the wind, during the Age of Heroes. Her divine parents forbade their love, but Durran and Elenei wed despite them. The gods' wrath was terrible to behold, destroying Durran's keep on his wedding night and killing all his family and guests, but Durran survived under Elenei's protection. Enraged, Durran declared war on the gods, who replied by hammering his kingdom with massive storms. Each time Durran built a castle to face the sea the gods destroyed it. King Durran persisted in building larger and more powerful fortifications, until finally the seventh castle, Storm's End, stayed in place and resisted the storms of Shipbreaker Bay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_13001;Tales from the Reach claim that Brandon the Builder was a descendant of Brandon of the Bloody Blade, a son of the mythical Garth Greenhand. According to legend, Brandon built the Wall and Winterfell, some stories say he did this with the help of giants. According to a ballad in Maester Childer's Winter's Kings, or the Legends and Lineages of the Starks of Winterfell, Brandon also sought assistance from the children of the forest. Tales from the stormlands claim Brandon helped Durran Godsgrief build Storm's End when he was a boy. Some stories claim King Uthor of the High Tower commissioned Brandon to design the stone Hightower at Oldtown.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;x
