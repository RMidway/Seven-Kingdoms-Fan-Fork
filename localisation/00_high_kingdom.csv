EVTDESCTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM0;For thousands of years [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] were ruled by petty kings. But now all of them are united in one realm, under the banner of house [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName]. Still, some of them call themselves kings, even though they swore fealty to me and are my legal subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATSK_HIGH_KINGDOM0;Let them keep their titles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TSKHIGHKINGDOMEVT0CUSTOM1;King-tier rulers continue calling themselves King or Queen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTSK_HIGH_KINGDOM1;[From.GetDynName] has named [From.GetHerselfHimself] High [From.GetKingQueen] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and now demands the remaining lands within this kingdom.
