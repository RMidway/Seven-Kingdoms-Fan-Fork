EVTDESC_tsk_andal_mig_0;An Andal warlord with hundreds of warriors has been seen wandering through your realm. Not only the peasants are fearing the host but also the local lords. They demand that you act as their liege [Root.GetTitle] and solve the issue immediately. Assimilating the host to a local holding would surely benefit your army but your vassals will surely disapprove.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_tsk_andal_mig_0;Let's negotiate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_tsk_andal_mig_0;Demand his leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_tsk_andal_mig_3_A;To the respectable [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nMy [Root.GetLordLady], you are a [Root.GetManWoman] blessed with prosperous lands and a beautiful family! It would honor me greatly to take care of the lordship of [selling_province.GetName] and your [marriage_child.GetDaughterSon], [marriage_child.GetTitledFirstName]. This would ensure a lasting peace between us.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_tsk_andal_mig_3_B;To the respectable [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nMy [Root.GetLordLady], your prosperous lands mark you as a [Root.GetTitle] of impressive abilities. I have an offer for you which would ensure a lasting peace between us. Let me rule the county of [selling_province.GetName] in your name, and no one shall dare to touch it again.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_tsk_andal_mig_3_C;To the respectable [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nMy [Root.GetLordLady], your prosperous lands mark you as a [Root.GetTitle] of impressive abilities. Let me rule the county of [selling_province.GetName] in your name, and no one shall dare to touch it again and marrying one of my noble [marriage_child.GetMenWomen] would ensure a lasting peace between us.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_tsk_andal_mig_3_A;[selling_province.GetName] and my [marriage_child.GetDaughterSon] can be yours, for the right price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_tsk_andal_mig_3_B;[selling_province.GetName] can be yours, for the right price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_tsk_andal_mig_3_C;[selling_province.GetName] and a marriage will suffice, for the right price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_tsk_andal_mig_3_TT;Offer your county §Y[selling_province.GetName]§! to the warlord §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! for the price of §G[selling_province.price.GetValue]§! And marry one of [From.GetHerHis] noble [marriage_child.GetMenWomen]. If [From.GetSheHe] accepts, [From.GetSheHe] will become your vassal and will offer you extra levies for 10 years.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_tsk_andal_mig_3_TT;Offer the county §Y[selling_province.GetName]§!, which is ruled by your vassal §Y[selling_province.Holder.GetTitledFirstName]§!, to the warlord §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§! and marry one of [From.GetHerHis] noble [marriage_child.GetMenWomen] for the price of §G[selling_province.price.GetValue]§!. If [From.GetSheHe] accepts, [From.GetSheHe] will become §Y[selling_province.Holder.GetTitledFirstName]'s§! vassal and will offer you extra levies for 10 years.\n\nHowever, your remaining vassals will be displeased, resulting in the following effect:\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_tsk_andal_mig_3_TT;Through the marriage, you form a non-aggression pact with §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_tsk_andal_mig_3;A threat dressed up in compliments is still a threat, [GetRootFromInsult]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_tsk_andal_mig_3_TT;Refuse to make a deal with the adventurer §Y[From.GetTitledFirstName]§!.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_tsk_andal_mig_3_tooltip;All other vassals opinion of §Y[Root.GetTitledFirstName]§! changes by §R-15§! for §Y5§! years. §Y(Sold Vassal County)§!\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_tsk_andal_mig_3_tooltip1;The Andal host settles in [selling_province.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_tsk_andal_mig_5_A;To the wise and noble [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nI am glad that we have come to an agreement. I will proudly serve as your vassal, and take good care of your [marriage_child.GetDaughterSon] and [selling_province.GetName] which shall prosper in my care. This I swear!\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_tsk_andal_mig_5_B;To the wise and noble [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nI am glad that we have come to an agreement. I will proudly serve as your vassal, and [selling_province.GetName] shall prosper in my care. This I swear!\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_tsk_andal_mig_5_C;To the wise and noble [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nI am glad that we have come to an agreement. I wish you good fortune with your new wife and will proudly serve as your vassal, and [selling_province.GetName] shall prosper in my care. This I swear!\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_tsk_andal_mig_5;I am glad we managed to solve this peacefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_tsk_andal_mig_6;If it will ensure peace, I must agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_tsk_andal_mig_6;Outrageous! We will meet again on the battlefield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_tsk_andal_mig_9;Today a large host of men, women and children were seen camping in [Root.GetName]. It appears that they are Andals who left their home in Essos and migrated to Westeros looking for a new place to live. Andals are know to be fierce warriors and good blacksmiths, allowing them to settle at our frontiers will surely benefit our defences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_A_tsk_andal_mig_9;A most welcome sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_B_tsk_andal_mig_9;Andals?!....Not in my realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
